## Description
BlackBox is a pedal project for the Daisy Seed platform, providing a solid hardware foundation for further audio and control development. This base code sets up all hardware components and pin assignments for easy expansion.

## Hardware Components
| Component   | Quantity | Description                |
|------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Button     | 3        | Momentary footswitches     |
| Encoder    | 2        | Rotary encoders (with clk) |
| Potentiometer | 2     | Analog control knobs       |
| LED        | 3        | Status indicators          |

## Pin Assignments
Pin assignments are placeholders and should be updated to match your hardware wiring.

## Getting Started
- Edit `BlackBox.cpp` to add your own audio processing or control logic.
- Update pin numbers as needed for your hardware.
